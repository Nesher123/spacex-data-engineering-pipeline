## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose & Domain

The **spacex-data-engineering-pipeline** project is designed to **ingest, validate, store, and aggregate SpaceX launch data** from public SpaceX APIs into a structured PostgreSQL database. It supports **incremental data ingestion**, ensuring efficient updates by fetching only new or changed launch records since the last pipeline run.

### Problem Solved

- Automates extraction of SpaceX launch data with **incremental updates** to avoid redundant full data reloads.
- Ensures **data quality and validation** via domain models.
- Maintains **historical raw data** alongside **aggregated metrics** for analytics.
- Provides **SQL analytics scripts** for performance, utilization, and payload analysis.
- Enables **monitoring and observability** of ingestion status and metrics.

### Target Users & Use Cases

- **Data Engineers**: To maintain and extend the ingestion pipeline.
- **Data Analysts / Scientists**: To query aggregated launch data and perform trend analysis.
- **DevOps / Platform Teams**: To deploy, monitor, and scale the pipeline.
- **Developers**: To build additional features or integrate with other systems.

### Core Business Logic & Domain Models

- **Launch Data Model**: Represents individual launches with fields like mission name, launch date, success status, payloads, and launchpad.
- **Incremental Ingestion Logic**: Detects new launches via `/latest` API endpoint, fetches only new data, validates, and inserts into DB.
- **Aggregation Model**: Computes and stores metrics such as total launches, success rates, average payload mass, and launch delays.
- **State Tracking**: Maintains ingestion state to enable idempotent incremental loads.

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### Core Pipeline (`src/ingest.py`)

- **Class:** `IncrementalIngestionPipeline`
  - Implements the **pipeline pattern** with sequential steps:
    - Initial load detection (`_is_initial_load`)
    - Change detection via `/latest` API (`_is_new_data_available`)
    - Incremental fetch with pagination (`_fetch_new_launches`)
    - Data validation into `Launch` models (`_validate_launches`)
    - Batch insertion into `raw_launches` table (`_insert_new_launches`)
    - Update ingestion state (`_update_ingestion_state`)
  - Uses **template method** pattern in `run_incremental_ingestion()` to orchestrate steps.
  - Returns detailed dict with status, metrics, and errors for observability.

### Domain Models (`src/models.py`)

- **`Launch`** (Pydantic model)
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `date_utc`, `success`, `payload_ids`, `total_payload_mass_kg`, `launchpad_id`, `static_fire_date_utc`.
  - Custom validators for date parsing and payload list normalization.
- **`LaunchAggregations`**
  - Aggregated metrics: total launches, success rate, average payload mass, launch delays.
  - Supports JSON serialization with datetime encoders.

### Database Layer (`src/database.py`)

- Manages PostgreSQL connection pooling.
- Provides methods for:
  - Checking ingestion state.
  - Inserting raw launch data.
  - Updating ingestion state.
  - Querying aggregation data.
- Uses environment variables for DB connection config.

### API Layer (`src/api.py`)

- Functions to fetch:
  - Latest launch metadata (`fetch_latest_launch`)
  - All launches or launches after a given date (`fetch_all_launches`, `fetch_launches_after_date`)
  - Payload data for mass calculation (`calculate_total_payload_mass`)
- Uses `requests` with error handling and logging.

### Aggregations (`src/aggregations.py`)

- `AggregationService` class computes and stores launch metrics.
- Supports:
  - Initial aggregation.
  - Incremental updates.
  - Trend analysis.
- Interacts with `Database` layer for persistence.

### SQL Analytics (`sql/analytics/*.sql`)

- Queries for:
  - Launch performance over time.
  - Launch site utilization.
  - Time between engine test and launch.
  - Top payload masses.
- Used for reporting and BI dashboards.

### Database Schema (`sql/init.sql`)

- Tables:
  - `raw_launches`: Append-only raw launch data.
  - `ingestion_state`: Tracks last fetched date/time.
  - `launch_aggregations`: Stores aggregated metrics with snapshot metadata.
- Indexes on `updated_at` and `snapshot_type` for query performance.

## 4. Development Patterns and Standards

### Code Organization

- **Modular design**: Clear separation between API, models, database, aggregation, and orchestration.
- **Layered architecture**: Domain models → API client → Orchestration → Database → Analytics.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module/class has a focused role.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Ingestion pipeline orchestrates steps with internal helpers.

### Testing

- `src/test_aggregations.py` provides CLI tests for aggregation logic.
- Tests cover:
  - Aggregation initialization.
  - Consistency checks.
  - Database validation.
  - Trend analysis.
- Encouraged to extend tests for ingestion and API layers.

### Error Handling & Logging

- Extensive use of try-except blocks in ingestion pipeline.
- Structured logging with `logging` module.
- Errors captured in result dicts for monitoring.
- API calls handle HTTP errors and retries (implied).

### Configuration Management

- Database connection parameters via environment variables.
- Logging configuration centralized in `api.py` and `database.py`.
- SQL schema managed via versioned scripts (`sql/init.sql`).

## 6. Usage and Operational Guidance

### Running the Pipeline

- Entry point: `src/ingest.py` with `run_ingestion()` function.
- Can be executed as a script or integrated into scheduled jobs.
- Produces detailed JSON-like dict output with ingestion metrics and errors.

### Database Setup

- Run `sql/init.sql` to initialize PostgreSQL schema before first run.
- Ensure PostgreSQL is accessible and environment variables for DB config are set.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Logs provide detailed step-by-step pipeline execution info.
- Result dict includes:
  - Number of launches fetched and inserted.
  - Duration of each pipeline step.
  - Aggregation update status.
  - Error messages if any.
- Aggregation trends can be visualized using `src/test_aggregations.py`.

### Scalability & Performance

- Incremental ingestion reduces load by fetching only new data.
- Batch inserts optimize database writes.
- Indexes on key columns speed up queries.
- Aggregations pre-compute metrics for fast analytics.

### Security Considerations

- No sensitive credentials in code; use environment variables.
- API calls are read-only and public.
- Database access should be secured with proper roles and network controls.
